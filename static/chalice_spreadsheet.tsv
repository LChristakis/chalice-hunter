The second pre lever dungeon (the first door after the first boss) with the uncanny reiterpallasch has one of those very large open rooms with the square platform in the middle, usually these rooms have the weird plant like enemies that shoot fireballs from far away and drop arcane haze. None of them in this room, but on the main platform is the hardest collection of enemies they could have put there. There's a chime maiden who summons spiders and weak goons, there's about 9 regular goons, a fatty with the gun, a brain sucker, a witch who casts fireballs, and i think an undead swordsman. Be very careful not to rush into that platform and try to take out the chime maiden asap. Happy hunting!
