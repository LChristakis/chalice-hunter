Chalice Seeker is a flask application designed to make perusing the Bloodborne Chalice spreadsheet simple . The spreadsheet is located at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18TVy5cDk6sNX0lc2dNQM2Q-SLv0_9QecQrtKR0sRb6Q/ and is imported into flask as a tab-separated document. 

The main page served by flask is a dynamic page that parses a tsv file stored on the server. The tsv file is displayed as a series of entries, one per chalice. The page uses jquery to filter these entries according to user input.
